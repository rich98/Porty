This is a Python script that scans a network to see if certain ports are open on the devices in that network. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

Import necessary modules: The script starts by importing the necessary Python modules. socket is used for network communications, ipaddress is used for handling and manipulating IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks, and concurrent.futures is used for creating a pool of worker threads.

Define scan_port function: This function tries to establish a connection to a specified port on a specified IP address. If the connection is successful, it means the port is open, and the function returns a message saying so. If the connection fails, it means the port is closed, and the function returns None.

Define scan_network function: This function takes an IP range and a port number as arguments. It creates a network from the IP range, then uses a thread pool to scan the specified port on each host in the network. If the scan_port function finds an open port, it prints a message.

Get user input: The script asks the user to enter an IP range and a port number. If the user enters ‘all’ for the port number, the script scans all well-known ports 0 - 1023.

Call scan_network function: Finally, the script calls the scan_network function with the user’s input. If the user entered a specific port number, the script tries to convert it to an integer. If this fails (because the user entered something that can’t be converted to an integer), the script prints an error message.

This script is a basic example of a port scanner, which is a tool that network administrators use to check the security of their networks. It’s important to note that you should only use this script to scan networks that you have permission to scan, as unauthorized scanning can be illegal.
